Dashing through the snow
On a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring,
Making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago,
I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago,
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.


Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bell chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock

Christmas, Christmas time is here,
And Christmas songs you love to hear
Thoughts of joy and hope and cheer,
But mostly shopping, shopping, shopping

Christmas, Christmas time is here,
The sleigh bells and the red-nosed deer
Songs and songs we love to hear
All played a thousand times each year

Heard this same song twenty times
And it's only Halloween (Joy To The World)
(I saw three ships come sailing in on Christmas Day on Christmas Day)
It's not even cold outside (deck the halls with boughs of holly)

Christmas, Christmas time is here,
(Hark The Herald Angels Sing)
And Christmas songs you love to hear
(Joy To The World)
Thoughts of joy and hope and cheer,
But mostly shopping, shopping, shopping

Christmas season
Starting sooner every year
It's October,
Stores with plastic Christmas trees

Ransack the mall,
Shop 'til you lose your mind
Spike the eggnog,
Sit back and watch Rudolph, Frosty, Tiny Tim, and Scrooge, the Grinch, or Charlie Brown

It's time...

It's time to do the Christmas can-can
If you can't, can't dance, well, that's OK (not going to do the kick line)
All you need is a tree, some lights about a thousand presents
Wrap them up and pray for snow

Run to your closet
Find your Christmas sweater
Screaming carols all the way (fa-la-la-la-la)
Maine all the way to California it's the Christmas can-can Halloween to Christmas day

It's the most wonderful time of year
We're running mad with Christmas cheer
Hey, what's troubling you, my friend?
It's not fair if you're Jewish, Jewish (not fair if you're Jewish, Jewish)

Dreidel, Dreidel, Dreidel
I made it out of clay
You realize that Christmas ain't the only holiday

Hey, he's right who made these laws?
Look! Wait! Here comes Santa Claus, Santa Claus, Santa Claus, Santa Claus, Santa Claus (Santa, Santa, Santa, Santa, Santa, Santa, Santa, Santa) (Guys? Guys!)

Hey, Santa do the can-can
Help them if you can-can
Join in the parade
(I'm gonna go grab some Chinese food)
All you need is a tree, some lights about a thousand presents
Wrap them up and pray for snow

Run to your closet
Find your Christmas sweater
Screaming carols all the way (fa-la-la-la-la)
France all the way to Indiana
It's the Christmas can-can
That's the end

Wait for our ending
We should share this holiday
Hava Nagila happy Hanukkah to you,
A happy Hanukkah to you, a happy Hanukkah to you
A merry Christmas, Hanukkah and also Kwanzaa.
Merry Christmas, happy Hanukkah, and merry Kwanzaa, too


I Want a Hippopotamus For Christmas
-- writing credits go to John Rox, copyright 1950. It's included on a
tape by "Joanie Bartel's Christmas Magic." 

"I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
I don't want a doll, no dinkey tinker toys
I want a hippopotamus to play with and enjoy

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
I don't think Santa Claus will mind, do you?
He won't have to use a dirty chimney flue
Just bring him through the front door
That's the easy thing to do

I can see me now on Christmas morning
Creeping down the stairs
Oh what joy, what surprise
When I open up my eyes
To see a hippo hero standing there

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
No crocodiles, no rhinosaurus
I only likes hippopotamuses [sic]
And hippopotamuses [sic] like me, too

Mom says a hippo would eat me up, but then
Teacher says a hippo is a vegetarian
There's lots of room for him in our two-car garage
I'd feed him there and wash him there and give him his massage."

O Come, O Come, Emmanuel

O come, O come, Emmanuel,
And ransom captive Israel,
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear.
Rejoice, rejoice! Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel.

O come, O come, Thou Lord of Might,
Who to Thy tribes, on Sinai's height,
In ancient times didst give the law,
In cloud, and majesty, and awe. Refrain

O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free
Thine own from Satan's tyranny;
From depths of hell Thy people save
And give them victory o'er the grave. Refrain

O come, Thou Dayspring, come and cheer
Our spirits by Thine advent here;
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night,
And death's dark shadows put to flight. Refrain

O come, Thou Key of David, come,
And open wide our heavenly home;
Make safe the way that leads on high,
And close the path to misery. Refrain

O come, Thou Wisdom from on high,
And order all things, far and nigh;
To us the path of knowledge show,
And cause us in her ways to go. Refrain

O come, Desire of nations, bind
In one the hearts of all mankind;
Bid Thou our sad divisions cease,
And be Thyself our King of peace. Refrain

I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day

I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old familiar carols play.
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of Peace on earth, good will to men.

I thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had roll'd along th' unbroken song
Of Peace on earth, good will to men.

And in despair, I bow'd my head:
"There is no peace on earth," I said,
"For hate is strong and mocks the song,
Of Peace on earth, good will to men."

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep;
"Good is not dead, nor doth He sleep;
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail,
With Peace on earth, good will to men."

Do You Hear What I Hear?

Said the night wind to the little lamb,
"Do you see what I see?
Way up in the sky, little lamb,
Do you see what I see?
A star, a star, dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite,
With a tail as big as a kite."

Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy,
"Do you hear what I hear?
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy,
Do you hear what I hear?
A song, a song high above the trees
With a voice as big as the the sea,
With a voice as big as the the sea."

Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king,
"Do you know what I know?
In your palace warm, mighty king,
Do you know what I know?
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold--
Let us bring him silver and gold,
Let us bring him silver and gold."

Said the king to the people everywhere,
"Listen to what I say!
Pray for peace, people, everywhere,
Listen to what I say!
The Child, the Child sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light,
He will bring us goodness and light."

The Holly And The Ivy

The holly and the ivy,
When they are both full grown,
Of all trees that are in the wood,
The holly bears the crown:
O, the rising of the sun,
And the running of the deer
The playing of the merry organ,
Sweet singing in the choir.

The holly bears a blossom,
As white as lily flow'r,
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ,
To be our dear Saviour: Refrain

The holly bears a berry,
As red as any blood,
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ,
To do poor sinners good: Refrain

The holly bears a prickle,
As sharp as any thorn,
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ,
On Christmas Day in the morn: Refrain

The holly bears a bark,
As bitter as the gall,
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ,
For to redeem us all: Refrain

The holly and the ivy,
When they are both full grown,
Of all trees that are in the wood,
The holly bears the crown: Refrain

Here We Come A-Wassailing

Here we come a-wassailing among the leaves so green;
Here we come a-wandering, so fair to be seen.
Love and joy come to you, and to you our wassail, too.
And God bless you and send you a Happy New Year
And God bless you and send you a Happy New Year

We are not daily beggars that beg from door to door;
But we are neighbours' children whom you have seen before. Refrain

We have a little purse made of ratching leather skin;
We want a little sixpence to line it well within. Refrain

God bless the master of this house, likewise the mistress, too;
And all the little children that round the table go. Refrain

Gloucestershire Wassail

Wassail, wassail all over the town!
Our bread it is white and our ale it is brown,
Our bowl, it is made of the good maple tree;
From the wassailing bowl we'll drink unto thee.

Come, butler, and fill us a bowl of your best,
And we hope your soul in Heaven may rest;
But if you do bring us a bowl of the small,
Then down shall go butler and bowl and all.

Come here, sweet maid, in the frilly white smock,
Come trip to the door and trip back the lock!
Come trip to the door and pull back the pin,
And let us jolly wassailers in.

Wihla Hutson

Caroling, caroling, now we go 
Christmas bells are ringing 
Caroling, caroling thru the snow 
Christmas bells are ringing 

Joyous voices sweet and clear 
Sing the sad of heart to cheer 
Ding dong, ding dong 
Christmas bells are ringing 

Caroling, caroling thru the town 
Christmas bells are ringing 
Caroling, caroling up and down 
Christmas bells are ringing 
Mark ye well the song we sing 
Gladsome tidings now we bring 
Ding dong, ding dong 
Christmas bells are ringing! 

Caroling, caroling, near and far 
Christmas bells are ringing 
Following, following yonder star 
Christmas bells are ringing 
Sing we all this happy morn 
"Lo, the King of heav'n is born!" 
Ding dong, ding dong 
Christmas bells are ringing

Silver Bells 
Jay Livingston and Ray Evans 

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style 
In the air 
There's a feeling 
of Christmas 
Children laughing 
People passing 
Meeting smile after smile 
And on ev'ry street corner you'll hear 

Silver bells, silver bells 
It's Christmas time in the city 
Ring-a-ling, hear them sing 
Soon it will be Christmas day 

Strings of street lights 
Even stop lights 
Blink a bright red and green 
As the shoppers rush 
home with their treasures 

Hear the snow crunch 
See the kids bunch 
This is Santa's big scene 
And above all this bustle 
You'll hear 
Silver bells, silver bells 
It's Christmas time in the city 
Ring-a-ling, hear them sing 
Soon it will be Christmas day

The Christmas Song 
Lyrics by Mel Torme 

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire 
Jack Frost nipping at your nose 
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir 
And folks dressed up like Eskimos 

Everybody knows a turkey and some 
Mistletoe help to make the season bright 
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow 
Will find it hard to sleep tonight 

They know that Santa's on his way 
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies 
On his sleigh 
And ev'ry mother's 
Child is gonna spy to see if 
Reindeer really know how to fly 

And so, I'm offering this 
Simple phrase to kids from 
One to ninety-two 
Altho' it's been said many times 
Many ways; "Merry Christmas to you"

Up on the Housetop 
B.R. Hanby 

Up on the housetop reindeer pause 
Out jumps good old Santa Claus 
Down thru the chimney with lots of toys 
All for the little ones 
Christmas joys 

Chorus 
Ho, ho, ho! 
Who wouldn't go! 
Ho, ho, ho! 
Who wouldn't go! 
Up on the housetop 
Click, click, click 
Down thru the chimney with 
Good Saint Nick 

First comes the stocking 
Of little Nell 
Oh, dear Santa 
Fill it well 
Give her a dolly 
That laughs and cries 
One that will open
And shut her eyes 

Repeat Chorus 

Next comes the stocking 
Of little Will 
Oh, just see what 
A glorious fill 
Here is a hammer 
And lots of tacks 
Also a ball 
And a whip that cracks 

Repeat Chorus

Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer 
Irish Rovers 

Grandma got run over by a reindeer 
Walking home from our house Christmas eve. 
You can say there's no such thing as Santa, 
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe. 

She'd been drinkin' too much egg nog, 
And we'd begged her not to go. 
But she'd left her medication, 
So she stumbled out the door into the snow. 

When they found her Christmas mornin', 
At the scene of the attack. 
There were hoof prints on her forehead, 
And incriminatin' Claus marks on her back. 

Grandma got run over by a reindeer, 
Walkin' home from our house Christmas eve. 
You can say there's no such thing as Santa, 
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe. 

Now were all so proud of Grandpa, 
He's been takin' this so well. 
See him in there watchin' football, 
Drinkin' beer and playin' cards with cousin Belle. 

It's not Christmas without Grandma. 
All the family's dressed in black. 
And we just can't help but wonder: 
Should we open up her gifts or send them back? 

Grandma got run over by a reindeer, 
Walkin' home from our house Christmas eve. 
You can say there's no such thing as Santa, 
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe. 

Now the goose is on the table 
And the pudding made of fig. 
And a blue and silver candle, 
That would just have matched the hair in Grandma's wig. 

I've warned all my friends and neighbours. 
Better watch out for yourselves." 
They should never give a license, 
To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves. 

Grandma got run over by a reindeer, 
Walkin' home from our house, Christmas eve. 
You can say there's no such thing as Santa, 
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.

I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus

I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night. 
She didn't see me creep 
Down the stairs to have a peep; 
She thought that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep. 
Then, I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus 
Underneath his beard so snowy white; 
Oh, what a laugh it would have been 
If Daddy had only seen 
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night.

Over the River and Through the Woods

Over the river and through the woods 
To Grandmother's house we go. 
The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh 
Through white and drifted snow. 

Over the river and through the woods, 
Oh, how the wind does blow. 
It stings the toes and bites the nose 
As over the ground we go. 

Over the river and through the woods 
To have a full day of play. 
Oh, hear the bells ringing ting-a-ling-ling, 
For it is Christmas Day. 

Over the river and through the woods, 
Trot fast my dapple gray; 
Spring o'er the ground just like a hound, 
For this is Christmas Day. 

Over the river and through the woods 
And straight through the barnyard gate. 
It seems that we go so dreadfully slow; 
It is so hard to wait. 

Over the river and through the woods, 
Now Grandma's cap I spy. 
Hurrah for fun; the pudding's done; 
Hurrah for the pumpkin pie.

A Visit from St.Nicholas 
by Clement C. Moore 

Down the chimney St.Nicholas came with a bound. 
He was dressed all in furs from his head to his foot, 
and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot; 
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, 
And he looked like a pedlar just opening his pack. 
His eyes how they twinkled! His dimples how merry! 
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry; 
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, 
And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow. 
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, 
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath. 
He had a broad face and a little round belly 
That shook, when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly. 
He was chubby and plump - a right jolly old elf - 
And laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.

It's Beginning to Look Like Christmas

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas 
Ev'rywhere you go; 
Take a look in the five-and-ten, glistening once again 
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow. 
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, 
Toys in ev'ry store, 
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be 
On your own front door. 

A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots 
Is the wish of Barney and Ben; 
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk 
Is the hope of Janice and Jen; 
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again. 
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas 
Ev'rywhere you go; 
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well, 
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow. 
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas; 
Soon the bells will start, 
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing 
Right within your heart.

Ding Dong! merrily on high 
In heav'n the bells are ringing 
Ding, dong! verily the sky 
Is riv'n with angel singing 
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis 

E'en so here below, below 
Let steeple bells be swungen 
And i-o, i-o, i-o 
By priest and people be sungen

Pray ye dutifully prime 
Your matin chime, ye ringers 
May ye beautifully rime 
Your evetime song, ye singers 
Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis

Frosty the Snow Man

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose 
and two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children 
know how he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in that 
old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head 
he began to dance around
O Frosty the snowman 
was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh 
and play just the same as you and me
Thumpetty thump thump
thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpetty thump thump
thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Frosty the snowman knew 
the sun was hot that day
So he said
"Let's run and 
we'll have some fun 
now before I melt away
" Down to the village
with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all 
around the square saying
Catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town 
right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when 
he heard him holler "Stop!" 
For Frosty the snow man 
had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying
"Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day
" Thumpetty thump thump
thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpetty thump thump
thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

White Christmas 
Irving Berlin 1942

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten 
and children listen 
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
With every Christmas card I write 
May your days be merry and bright 
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas 
With every Christmas card I write 
May your days be merry and bright 
And may all your Christmases be white

Mr. Grinch

You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch 
You really are a heel, 
You're as cuddly as a cactus, you're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch, 
You're a bad banana with a greasy black peel! 

You're a monster, Mr. Grinch, 
Your heart's an empty hole, 
Your brain is full of spiders, you have garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch, 
I wouldn't touch you with a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole! 

You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch, 
You have termites in your smile, 
You have all the tender sweetness of a seasick crocodile, Mr. Grinch, 
Given a choice between the two of you I'd take the seasick crocodile! 

You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch, 
You're the king of sinful sots, 
Your heart's a dead tomato splotched with moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch, 
You're a three decker sauerkraut and toadstool sandwich with arsenic sauce!

You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch, 
With a nauseous super "naus"!, 
You're a crooked dirty jockey and you drive a crooked hoss, Mr. Grinch, 
Your soul is an appalling dump heap overflowing with the most disgraceful 
assortment of rubbish imaginable mangled up in tangled up knots! 

You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch, 
You're a nasty wasty skunk, 
Your heart is full of unwashed socks, your soul is full of gunk, Mr. Grinch, 
The three words that best describe you are as follows, and I quote, 
"Stink, stank, stunk"!

Gentle Mary Laid Her Child

[Joseph S. Cook, 1919]
Gentle Mary laid her Child 
Lowly in a manger. 
There He lay, the Undefiled, 
To the world a stranger. 
Such a Babe in such a place, 
Can He be the Savior? 
Ask the saved of all the race 
Who have found His favor. 

Angels sang about His birth, 
Wise men sought and found Him. 
Heaven's star shone brightly forth 
Glory all around Him. 
Shepherds saw the wondrous sight, 
Hear the angels singing. 
All the plains were lit that night, 
All the hills were ringing. 

Gentle Mary laid her Child 
Lowly in a manger. 
He is still the Undefiled, 
But no more a stranger. 
Son of God of humble birth, 
Beautiful the story. 
Praise His name in all the earth. 
Hail! The King of Glory!

Go Tell It On The Mountain

When I was a seeker 
I sought both night and day, 
I asked the Lord to help me, 
And he showed me the way. 

Chorus 
Go tell it on the mountain, 
Over the hills and everywhere,
Go tell it on the mountain, 
Our Jesus Christ is born. 

He made me a watchman 
Upon a city wall, 
And if I am a Christian, 
I am the least of all. 

Chorus 
Go tell it on the mountain, 
Over the hills and everywhere,
Go tell it on the mountain, 
Our Jesus Christ is born.

Jingle Bells

James Pierpont - 1857
Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh 
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way; 
Bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits bright 
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight 

Chorus 
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! 
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh 
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way! 
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh 

A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride 
And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side; 
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot; 
He got into a drifted bank and we got upsot 
(Chorus) 

A day or two ago, the story I must tell 
I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell; 
A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh 
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away 
(Chorus)

Now the ground is white, go it while you're young 
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song; 
Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed 
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead 
(Chorus)

Jolly Old Saint Nicholas

Jolly old Saint Nicholas, 
Lean your ear this way! 
Don't you tell a single soul 
What I'm going to say; 
Christmas Eve is coming soon; 
Now, you dear old man, 
Whisper what you'll bring to me; 
Tell me if you can. 

When the clock is striking twelve, 
When I'm fast asleep, 
Down the chimney broad and black, 
With your pack you'll creep; 
All the stockings you will find 
Hanging in a row; 
Mine will be the shortest one, 
You'll be sure to know. 

Johnny wants a pair of skates; 
Susy wants a dolly; 
Nellie wants a story book; 
She thinks dolls are folly; 
As for me, my little brain 
Isn't very bright; 
Choose for me, old Santa Claus, 
What you think is right.

We Three Kings of Orient Are

[John H. Hopkins, Jr., 1857]
We three kings of Orient are 
Bearing gifts we traverse afar. 
Field and fountain, moor and mountain, 
Following yonder star. 

Chorus 
O star of wonder, star of night, 
Star with royal beauty bright, 
Westward leading, still proceeding, 
Guide us to thy perfect Light. 

Born a king on Bethlehem's plain, 
Gold I bring to crown Him again, 
King forever, ceasing never 
Over us all to reign. 
(Chorus) 

Frankincense to offer have I. 
Incense owns a Deity nigh. 
Prayer and praising all men raising, 
Worship Him, God on high. 
(Chorus) 

Myrrh is mine: Its bitter perfume 
Breaths a life of gathering gloom. 
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding dying, 
Sealed in the stone-cold tomb. 
(Chorus) 

Glorious now behold Him arise, 
King and God and Sacrifice. 
Alleluia, alleluia! 
Sounds through the earth and skies. 
(Chorus)

All I Want For Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth

Every body stops
and stares at me
These two teeth are
gone as you can see
I don't know just who
to blame for this catastrophe!
But my one wish on Christmas Eve
is as plain as it can be!

All I want for Christmas
is my two front teeth,
my two front teeth,
see my two front teeth!
Gee, if I could only
have my two front teeth,
then I could with you
"Merry Christmas."
It seems so long since I could say,
"Sister Susie sitting on a thistle!"

Gosh oh gee, how happy I'd be,
if I could only whistle (thhhh)
All I want for Christmas
is my two front teeth,
my two front teeth,
see my two front teeth.
Gee, if I could only
have my two front teeth,
then I could wish you
"Merry Christmas!"

Blue Christmas
B.Hayes, J.Johnson (c) 1948

I'll have a blue Christmas without you;
I'll be so blue thinking about you.
Decorations of red
on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing if
you're not here with me.

I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain;
And when that blue heartache starts hurting,
You'll be doing all right
with your Christmas of white,
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas.

Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas
from the film Meet Me In St. Louis
Hugh Martin, Ralph Blane 1943

Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
Let your heart be light
From now on,
our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
Make the Yule-tide gay,
From now on,
our troubles will be miles away.

Here were are as in olden days,
happy golden days of yore.
Faithful friends who are dear to us
gather near to us once more.

Through the years we all will be together
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now.

Here Comes Santa Claus
Gene Autry, Oakley Haldeman (c) 1947

Here comes Santa Claus!
Here comes Santa Claus!
Right down Santa Claus Lane!
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer
are pulling on the reins.
Bells are ringing, children singing;
All is merry and bright.
Hang your stockings and say your prayers,
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.

Here comes Santa Claus!
Here comes Santa Claus!
Right down Santa Claus Lane!
He's got a bag that is filled with toys
for the boys and girls again.
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle,
What a beautiful sight.
Jump in bed, cover up your head,
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight.

Holly Jolly Christmas
Johnny Marks (c) 1972

Have a holly, jolly Christmas;
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow,
but have a cup of cheer.
Have a holly, jolly Christmas;
And when you walk down the street
Say Hello to friends you know
and everyone you meet.

Oh, ho, the mistletoe
hung where you can see;
Somebody waits for you;
Kiss her once for me.
Have a holly jolly Christmas,
and in case you didn't hear,
Oh by golly, have a holly,
jolly Christmas this year.

Where the love-light gleams. 
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams.

Jingle Bell Rock
Bobby Helms

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun.

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air.

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell,
That's the jingle bell,
That's the jingle bell rock.

Let It Snow!
Sammy Cahn, Jule Styne (c) 1945

Oh, the weather outside is frightful,
But the fire is so delightful,
And since we've no place to go,
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

It doesn't show signs of stopping,
And I brought some corn for popping;
The lights are turned way down low,
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

When we finally say good night,
How I'll hate going out in the storm;
But if you really hold me tight,
All the way home I'll be warm.

The fire is slowly dying,
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing,
But as long as you love me so.
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

Rocking Around the Christmas Tree
Brenda Lee

Rocking around the Christmas tree
at the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
every couple tries to stop
Rocking around the Christmas tree,
let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
and we'll do some caroling.

You will get a sentimental
feeling when you hear
Voices singing let's be jolly,
deck the halls with boughs of holly
Rocking around the Christmas tree,
have a happy holiday
Everyone dancing merrily
in the new old-fashioned way.

Sleigh Ride
Mitchell Parish, Leroy Anderson 1948

Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing 
Ring ting tingle-ing too 
Come on, it's lovely weather 
For a sleigh ride together with you 

Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling "You Hoo" 
Come on, it's lovely weather 
For a sleigh ride together with you 

Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap let's go 
Let's look at the snow 
We're riding in a wonderland of snow 

Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap it's grand 
Just holding your hand 
We're gliding along with the song 
Of a wintry fairy land 

Our cheeks are nice and rosy 
And comfy cozy are we 
We're snuggled up together like two 
Birds of a feather would be 

Let's take the road before us 
And sing a chorus or two 
Come on, it's lovely weather 
For a sleigh ride together with you 

There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray 
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day 
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop 
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop 
Pop! Pop! Pop! 

There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy 
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie 
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives 
These wonderful things are the things 
We remember all through our lives

Among the leaves so green,
Here we come a wand'ring,
So fair to be seen.

Chorus
Love and joy come to you,
And to your wassail too,
And God bless you and send you a happy new year,
And God send you a happy new year.

We are not daily beggars
Who beg from door to door,
But we are neighbor's children
Whom you have seen before.

Chorus
Love and joy come to you,
And to your wassail too,
And God bless you and send you a happy new year,
And God send you a happy new year.

We have a little purse
Made of ratching leather skin;
We want some of your small change
To line it well within.

Chorus
Love and joy come to you,
And to your wassail too,
And God bless you and send you a happy new year,
And God send you a happy new year.

God bless the Master of this house,
Likewise the Mistress too;
And all the little children
That round the table go.

Chorus
Love and joy come to you,
And to your wassail too,
And God bless you and send you a happy new year,
And God send you a happy new year.

Winter Wonderland
Dick Smith, Felix Bernard 1934

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
in the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
we're happy tonight,
walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird,
here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
as we go along,
walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
we'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
when you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
as we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
the plans that we've made,
walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
and pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
until the other kiddies knock him down.

When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
walking in a winter wonderland.

Walking in a winter wonderland,
walking in a winter wonderland.

Winter Wonderland (Or the un-traditional one for)

Lacy things -- the wife is missin',
Didn't ask -- her permission,
I'm wearin' her clothes,
Her silk pantyhose,
Walkin' 'round in women's underwear.

In the store -- there's a teddy,
Little straps -- like spaghetti,
It holds me so tight,
Like handcuffs at night,
Walkin' 'round in women's underwear.

In the office there's a guy named Melvin, He pretends that I am Murphy Brown.
He'll say, "Are you ready?" I'll say,"Whoa, Man!" "Let's wait until our wives are out of town!"

Later on, if you wanna,
We can dress -- like Madonna,
Put on some eyeshade,
And join the parade,
Walkin' 'round in women's underwear!

Lacy things... missin',
Didn't ask... permission,
Wearin' her clothes,
Her silk pantyhose,
Walkin' 'round in women's underwear,
Walkin' 'round in women's underwear,
Walkin' 'round in women's underwear!

The Holly and the Ivy

The holly and the ivy,
When they are both full grown,
Of all the trees that are in the wood,
The holly bears the crown.

O the rising of the sun,
And the running of the deer,
The playing of the merry organ,
Sweet singing in the choir.

The holly bears a blossom
As white as lily flower;
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
To be our sweet Savior.

The holly bears a berry
As red as any blood;
Any Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
To do poor sinners good.

The holly bears a prickle
As sharp as any thorn;
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
On Christmas day in the morn.

The holly bears a bark
As bitter as any gall;
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
For to redeem us all.

The holly and the ivy,
When they are both full grown,
Of all the trees that are in the wood,
The holly bears the crown.

Let this be my solemn vow;
To take each moment and live
Each moment in peace eternally
Let there be peace on earth

While Shepherds Watch Their Flocks

While Shepherds watch their flocks by night
All seated on the ground
The angel of the Lord came down
And glory shone arond
"Fear not," said he for mighty dread
had seized their troubled mind
"Glad tidings of great joy I bring
To you and all man-kind"

"To you in David's town this day
Is born of David's line
The Savior who is Christ the Lord
And this shall me the sign
The heav'n'ly babe you there shall find
To human view displayed
All meanly wrapped in swathing bands
And in a manger laid"

Thus spoke the seraph and forth-with
Appeared a shiny throng
Of angels praising God who thus
Addressed their joyful song
"All glory be to God on high
And on the earth be peace
Goodwill hence-forth from heav'n to men
Begin and never cease"

I HEARD THE BELLS ON CHRISTMAS DAY

(Henry Wadsworth Longfellow)

I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play,
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

I thought how, as the day had come,
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along th' unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

And in despair I bowed my head
"There is no peace on earth," I said,
"For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men."

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
"God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With peace on earth, good will to men."

Till ringing, singing on its way
The world revolved from night to day,
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

Nuttin' For Christmas

S. Tepper, R. Bennett (c) 1955
I broke my bat on Johnny's head;
Somebody snitched on me.
I hid a frog in sister's bed;
Somebody snitched on me.
I spilled some ink on Mommy's rug;
I made Tommy eat a bug;
Bought some gum with a penny slug;
Somebody snitched on me.

Oh, I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas
Mommy and Daddy are mad.
I'm getting nuttin' for Christmas
'Cause I ain't been nuttin' but bad.

I put a tack on teacher's chair
somebody snitched on me.
I tied a knot in Susie's hair
somebody snitched on me.
I did a dance on Mommy's plants
climbed a tree and tore my pants
Filled the sugar bowl with ants
somebody snitched on me.

So, I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas
Mommy and Daddy are mad.
I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas
'Cause I ain't been nuttin' but bad.

I won't be seeing Santa Claus;
Somebody snitched on me.
He won't come visit me because
Somebody snitched on me.
Next year I'll be going straight;
Next year I'll be good, just wait
I'd start now, but it's too late;
Somebody snitched on me.

So you better be good whatever you do
'Cause if you're bad, I'm warning you,
You'll get nuttin' for Christmas.

Pine Cones And Holly Berries

Pine cones and Holly Berries
Popcorn for you, apples for me
Red striped candy, nut cracker handy
Kettle a-bubbleing hot as can be.
snow clouds hang low and threatening
Maybe in won't, praying it may
the brightest fireplace glows in every face
Waiting for Christmas day.

There'll be walk-a-round songs and
talk-a-round songs
Songs of the inn and stable.
There'll be morning time songs and
evening time songs
And grace at every table.
And Jingle bells will jingle all the way all day.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel,
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart.

Sleep Well, Little Children

A.Bergman, L.Klatzkin (c) 1956

Sleep well, little children,
wherever you are;
Tomorrow is Christmas
beneath every star.
Soon the snowflakes will fall
and tomorrow you'll see
Every wish, one and all,
waiting under the tree.

Sleep well, little children,
pleasant dreams through the night;
Tomorrow is Christmas,
all merry and bright.
Soon you'll hear the bells ring,
time for dreams to come true
As the world wakes to bring
Merry Christmas to you.

A Baby Just Like You

John Denver, J. Henry (c) 1975

The season is upon us now
A time for gifts and giving
And as the year draws to its close
I think about my living

The Christmas time when I was young,
The magic and the wonder,
But colors dull and candles dim,
And dark my standing under

O little Zachary, shining light
You've set my soul to dreaming
You've given back my joy in life
And filled me with new meaning

A Savior King was born that day,
A baby just like you,
And as the Magi came with gifts,
I come with my gift too

That peace on Earth fills up your time,
That brotherhood surrounds you.
That you may know the warmth of love,
And wrap it all around you

It's just a wish, a dream I'm told
From days when I was young
Merry Christmas, little Zachary
Merry Christmas, everyone
Merry Christmas, little Zachary
Merry Christmas, everyone

Christmas Dinner

Paul Stookey, 1963

And it came to pass on a Christmas evening
While all the doors were shuttered tight
Outside standing, lonely boy-child
Cold and shivering in the night

On the street, every window
Save but one, was gleaming bright
And to this window walked the boy-child
Peeking in saw, candle light

Through other windows he had looked at turkeys
Ducks and geese, cherry pies
But through this window saw a grey-haired lady
Table bare and tears in her eyes

Into his coat reached the boy-child
Knowing well there was little there
He took from his pocket,
his own Christmas dinner
A bit of cheese, some bread to share

His outstretched hands
held the food and they trembled
As the door, it opened wide
Said he, Would you share with me Christmas dinner
Gently said she, Come inside

The grey-haired lady brought forth to the table
Glasses two and her last drop of wine
Said she, Here's a toast to everyone's Christmas
and especially, yours and mine

And it came to pass on that Christmas evening
While all the doors were shuttered tight
That in that town, the happiest Christmas
Was shared by candle light

Christmas For Cowboys

S. Weisberg (c) 1975

Tall in the saddle we spend Christmas day
Driving the cattle on the snow-covered plains.
All of the good gifts given today;
Ours is the sky and the wide open range.

Back in the cities, they have different ways,
Football and eggnog and Christmas parades.
I'll take the blanket; I'll take the reins;
Christmas for Cowboys and wide open plains.

A campfire for warmth as we stop for the night;
The stars overhead are the Christmas-tree lights.
The wind sings a hymn as we bow down to pray;
Christmas for Cowboys and the wide open plains.

It's tall in the saddle we spend Christmas Day,
Driving the cattle on the snow-covered plains.
So many gifts have been opened today;
Ours is the sky and the wide open range.
It's Christmas for Cowboys and wide open plains.

Christmas In Killarney

The holly green, the ivy green
The prettiest picture you've ever seen
Is Christmas in Killarney
With all of the folks at home

It's nice, you know, to kiss your beau
While cuddling under the mistletoe
And Santa Claus you know, of course
Is one of the boys from home

The door is always open
The neighbors pay a call
And Father John before he's gone
Will bless the house and all

How grand it feels to click your heels
And join in the fun of the jigs and reels
I'm handing you no blarney
The likes you've never known
Is Christmas in Killarney
With all of the folks at home

It's The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year

Eddie Pola, George Wyle 1963

It's the most wonderful time of the year.
With the kids jingle belling,
and everyone telling you,
"Be of good cheer,"
It's the most wonderful time of the year.

There'll be parties for hosting,
marshmallows for toasting and
caroling out in the snow.
there'll be scary ghost stories and
tales of the glories of Christmases
long, long ago.

It's the most wonderful time of the year.
There'll be much mistletoeing
and hearts will be glowing,
when loved ones are near.
It's the most wonderful time of the year.

THIS IS THAT TIME OF THE YEAR
1967 ForTe Music, Inc. & Edwin H. Morris & Co., Inc.
(Jack Jones and Chorus)

This is that time of the year,
A tinselly, glittery time;
Long distance calls to uncle and aunt,
On ev'ry corner you bump into Santa,
'Cause this is that time of the year,
A holly and jolly old time;
Windows are dressed in ribbons of silk,
And Junior drinks all of his milk!
Poppa . . . keeps buying presents
And sneaks them into the closet;
Momma . . . goes to the bank
But she holds out a dollar from ev'ry deposit;
'Cause this is that time of the year,
A silver bow, mistletoe time;
Spirits are high, good will and good cheer,
We're putting the tree up,
The kids shouldn't be up,
Saint Nick says, "Giddeyup!"
To Dasher, Dancer, Blitzen, Prancer;
This is that time of the year!

This is that time of the year,
A tinselly, glittery time;
Dumpling and goose and pudding and pie,
(Perfect excuse to go right off your diet!)
'Cause this is that time of the year,
A holly and jolly old time;
Snow on your roof, your face and your shoes,
And presents that you'll; never use!
Grandma . . . feels twenty-two so,
She dons her gayest apparel;
He stands at the spinet and sings ev'ry carol;
'Cause this is that time of the year,
A silver bow, mistletoe time;
Etc.'
